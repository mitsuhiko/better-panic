`better-panic` gives you pretty backtraces for panics.

It is inspired by Python tracebacks and tries to replicate them as well
as possible.  This is what it looks like:

Some of the code is based on the
[color-backtrace](https://crates.io/crates/color-backtrace) library.

## Usage

The most common way to use it is to invoke the `install` function
which installs a panic handler.  In debug builds the backtrace is shown
automatically, in release builds it's hidden by default.

```rust
better_panic::install();
```

For more configuration see the `Settings` object.

## Features

- Colorize backtraces to be easier on the eyes
- Show source snippets if source files are found on disk
- Hide all the frames after the panic was already initiated
